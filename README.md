PKP Web Application Library
=======

The PKP Web Application Library (PKP-WAL) is a library shared by [Open Journal Systems (OJS)](http://github.com/pkp/ojs), [Open Conference Systems (OCS)](http://github.com/pkp/ocs), [Open Monograph Press (OMP)](http://github.com/pkp/omp), and [Open Harvester Systems (OHS)](http://github.com/pkp/harvester). It is distributed with those applications in the lib/pkp subdirectory.

Issues (bugs) for all of those applications should be [created against this repository](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues).

## Issues
Issues (bugs) for any of the PKP applications should be created here. If you're not sure whether you're encountering a bug or not, consider posting in the [PKP Support Forum](http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum).
